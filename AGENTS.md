# AGENTS.md

## Instructions for AI Agents

When working with this project, always:

1. **Reference CLAUDE.md first** - Contains essential project instructions, build system details, and architecture guidelines
2. **Check all markdown files** in the project root and subdirectories for additional context
3. **Exclude vendor directories** - Do not reference any markdown files under `vendor/` paths as they contain external documentation

Follow the guidelines in CLAUDE.md exactly as written - they override default behaviors.
